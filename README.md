## Introduction

`ConstraintLayout` is a powerful and versatile layout manager in Android that allows you to create complex and responsive layouts while maintaining a flat view hierarchy. This tutorial provides an example of how to use various features of `ConstraintLayout` to build a sample layout.

## Features Demonstrated

This tutorial demonstrates the following features of `ConstraintLayout`:

- **Basic Constraints:** Positioning views relative to each other and the parent.
- **Chains:** Creating a horizontal or vertical chain of views with different styles.
- **Guidelines:** Using vertical and horizontal guidelines to align views.
- **Barriers:** Aligning views based on the maximum or minimum size of other views.


## How to Use

1. **Create a New Project:**
   - Open Android Studio.
   - Create a new project with an Empty Activity.

2. **Add Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have the latest version of `ConstraintLayout` in your `build.gradle` file:
     ```gradle
     dependencies {
         implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.1.4'
     }
     ```

3. **Replace Layout File:**
   - Replace the content of your `activity_main.xml` file with the provided XML code.

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Build and run the application to see the layout in action.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error: `Unresolved attribute`**
  - Make sure you have the latest version of the `ConstraintLayout` library.

- **Error: `View not displaying correctly`**
  - Ensure all attributes and IDs are correctly specified and match those referenced in the constraints.
